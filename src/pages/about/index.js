            The CCAP Nkhoma Synod was founded in 1889 by missionaries from the Dutch Reformed Church. The mission began when Rev. Andrew Charles Murray from the Dutch Reformed Church joined forces with Dr. Robert Laws of the Free Church of Scotland in Bandawe, Malawi. The first mission station was established at Mvera, and later, Kongwe became the second mission station in 1892.

            The mission rapidly expanded, and by 1897, the first group of 19 believers were baptized. Among them were notable Christians like Simioni Gora, Dawide Tsirizani, Izake Kapologulani, and Solomon Kambere. The mission continued to grow, and in 1929, Petros Kachingwe became one of the first Malawians ordained as a minister in the Nkhoma Synod.

            The Nkhoma Synod has always been committed to education and healthcare. It established the Nkhoma Institute for Continued Theological Training and Zomba Theological University. The Nkhoma Hospital, a 220-bed health facility, was also established to serve the central area of Malawi. Additionally, the synod runs 10 health centers and the Nkhoma College of Nursing.

            In response to the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic, the Nkhoma Synod established the HIV/AIDS Community Program in January 2000. This program aims to provide support and care to those affected by the disease.

            Today, the CCAP Nkhoma Synod consists of 124 congregations and 1,298 prayer houses, serving approximately 800,000 members. The synod meets every two years and has adopted the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort as its doctrinal standards. It is also a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches.
